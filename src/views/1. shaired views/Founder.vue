        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Julie Robbins</h2>
        <p>Julie is a holistic business coach that helps people find their path in life. Although you will not see Julie with a drum and drumsticks in hand on a daily basis, she has her own positive beat of productivity. Julie is currently on the board for the New Paltz Regional Chamber of Commerce and The Arts Community.  She believes in supporting and helping business owners succeed at One Epic Place by helping them find their purpose and their own individual way of thriving in their business. Julie has an immense zest for life (that can actually be quite scary sometimes).  She is a mom of 3 boys, loves her hammock and lives to travel.  Nicole would best describe her partner in crime as “seriously badass”, wicked smart, and my rock.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Our Story</h2>
        <p>Julie and Nicole came together because of common needs: a place to hang a shingle, the desire to start businesses to help others, and to be part of the community. They both wanted a professional place to do business but didn’t have the ability to afford it individually. They realized in order to make money they needed to see clients, and in order to see clients they needed a place to do it.</p>
        <p>As they shared their first space and slowly grew their businesses, they saw the same situation many times with friends and colleagues. Their purpose, business goals, and path started to change in a very unexpected and exciting way. It seemed their purpose and place in this community had bigger plans than they even initially dreamed.</p>
        <p>As Julie and Nicole got to know each other, they realized they both came from a similar legacy… one of community building, leadership, and some surprising similarities.. Their combined histories, educational backgrounds, personalities and talents, dreams and passions, made it clear that they were a force to be reckoned with. And so birthed One EPIC Place.</p>
