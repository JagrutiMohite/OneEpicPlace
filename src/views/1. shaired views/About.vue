        Who Are We
      </h3>

      <div class="blog-post">

        <p class="text-muted">From our humble beginning as two business/wellness coaches looking for space to conduct business, to now being a hub where a couple dozen local solopreneurs are growing their businesses and thriving, we’re proud to be a place that Empowers People and Inspires Change (EPIC).</p>
        <p class="text-muted">One EPIC Place is an affordable, collaborative workspace, providing local businesses a flexible location and supportive community to grow their business or practice, no matter what stage of growth they are in.  We have shared workspaces, private offices and treatment rooms, workshop/conference rooms, a kitchen, studio, and a creative and fun atmosphere all under one roof offering flexible and endless opportunities for local entrepreneurs.</p>

       <br><br>
        <p class="text-muted">Shared workspaces have been on the rise in recent years, but we realized there was nothing quite like this in our local community. While we enjoy providing a place where businesses can grow and network, we pay special attention to helping a rich and diverse group of solopreneurs to thrive both personally and professionally in an empowering community so they don’t have to go it alone.</p>
        
        <p class="text-muted">One EPIC Place is much more than just a space to rent or work occasionally. Our collaborative environment is overflowing with the resources, inspiration, and structure needed to be a successful entrepreneur. We support and guide our members, promote their businesses, offer sources for networking and growth, hold workshops and meetings for support, serve as accountability partners, provide the necessary tools they need for them and their businesses. We offer solopreneurs the infrastructure to grow their business and the ability to tap into the resources in their community.</p>
       
        <p class="text-muted">Our mission and vision have grown substantially from our initial small location behind the New Paltz Chamber of Commerce office. Our purpose and place in this community is bigger than we knew. Our collective backgrounds, education and experiences, mixed with our strong desire to help others find and live their purpose and to grow community, are part of the foundation of One EPIC Place.</p>
        
        <p class="text-muted">OEP members offer services such as nutritional and wellness coaching, massage, music lessons, art therapy, body and energy work, many healing modalities, cooking classes, meditation workshops, yoga, advocacy for children with special needs, qi gong, business coaching, tech therapy, marketing, public relations, web design, community events, and so much more.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">Membership packages give access to members to book private rooms, hot desk spaces, workshop rooms, and the kitchen. Amenities include all utilities, wifi, coffee/tea, member rates for coaching with co-founders Julie and Nicole, use of our Main St. address, parking, and a discounted membership to the New Paltz Regional Chamber Commerce.</p>
