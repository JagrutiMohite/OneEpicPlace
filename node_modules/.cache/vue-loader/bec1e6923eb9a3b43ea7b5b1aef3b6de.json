Throughout the morning and afternoon, Pat engages in conversations with Ann, Jane, and Jaime, in between working on his marketing plan… then spends some time in the conference room helping Sue with her new website.  At 12:30, before he heads to one of the treatment rooms for a massage with Sharon, he signs up for the member potluck on Friday.  After his treatment he heads to the kitchen to heat up his leftover tofu wrap, then heads to the stone porch in the back to enjoy lunch.  At 3, Pat’s kids show up for music lessons in the studio with Pete, while Betty has her coaching session with Nicole and Julie.
