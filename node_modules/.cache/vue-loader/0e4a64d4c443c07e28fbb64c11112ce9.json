She believes in supporting and helping business owners succeed at One Epic Place by helping them find their purpose and their own individual way of thriving in their business. Julie has an immense zest for life (that can actually be quite scary sometimes).  She is a mom of 3 boys, loves her hammock and lives to travel.  Nicole would best describe her partner in crime as “seriously badass”, wicked smart, and my rock.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <img class=\"bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"http://www.oneepicplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/julie-robbins.jpg\"  focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Placeholder: 250x250\"><title>Placeholder</title><rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#eee\"/><text x=\"50%\" y=\"50%\" fill=\"#aaa\" dy=\".3em\">250x250</text>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<hr class=\"featurette-divider\">\n\n<div class=\"row featurette\">\n  <div class=\"col-md-8 order-md-2\">\n    <h2 class=\"featurette-heading\">Nicole Langlois</h2>\n    <p>Nicole is best described as the energizer bunny….She keeps going, going, going.

They both wanted a professional place to do business but didn’t have the ability to afford it individually. They realized in order to make money they needed to see clients, and in order to see clients they needed a place to do it.</p>\n    <p>As they shared their first space and slowly grew their businesses, they saw the same situation many times with friends and colleagues. Their purpose, business goals, and path started to change in a very unexpected and exciting way. It seemed their purpose and place in this community had bigger plans than they even initially dreamed.</p>\n    <p>As Julie and Nicole got to know each other, they realized they both came from a similar legacy… one of community building, leadership, and some surprising similarities.. Their combined histories, educational backgrounds, personalities and talents, dreams and passions, made it clear that they were a force to be reckoned with. And so birthed One EPIC Place.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    <img class=\"bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto\" width=\"250\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://www.oneepicplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2015-10-16-12.46.45-2-1024x653.jpg\"  focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Placeholder: 250x250\"><title>Placeholder</title><rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#eee\"/><text x=\"50%\" y=\"50%\" fill=\"#aaa\" dy=\".3em\">250x250</text>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n    </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
